title: Steps to Turn Your Idea Into Reality
---

I have this great idea — how do I make it happen?

For a lot of people, the new year brings with it a renewed effort to accomplish something new. However oftentimes, many resolutions and ideas fizzle out after a few days or months. Why is this? Are we lying to ourselves about what we want, and what we are willing to give up to get it? Are we just too lazy or forgetful? Or is there something else that stands in the way of making an idea happen? I strongly believe that no matter how small or large, ideas should not fizzle out because we are just too lazy or forget about them. Whether you want to go to the gym every day or you want to build a rocket, there are 5 key principles that can turn your idea into legit reality.

1. Write it down. Look at it every day.
Writing down what you actually want has many benefits. It helps you flesh out what it is that you actually want in a clear, well-defined manner. Writing your idea down lets you take a step back and view it from a third-party standpoint. Writing helps you understand what you’re trying to achieve.
Where you write down your idea is equally as important. Writing the idea down is meant to help you remember what you want. It’s meant to encourage you to think about your idea all the time and to drive you to work on your idea. Your idea should be written in a place that you see every day. I enjoy putting my ideas and goals as the Desktop background to my laptop. I see the background every day and remember what I want to accomplish. Another great trick is putting your idea on the ceiling above your bed (or, if you’re still in college like me, on the bottom of the top bunk). That way, every morning and every night before bed, you’re re-inspired to work towards your goal.

2. Have an incremental plan.
Your idea isn’t going to happen by itself. If you want to become the CEO, start by becoming an intern! Make a distinct plan to meet influential people at your job, and learn from them. Make sure to impress one person every single day. Likewise, if you want to build a fleet of drones, start with one! Learn how to program, tell it to do what you want it to do and continue learning until your fleet of drones can make you a sandwich.

Having a fully fleshed out plan from day 1 of being an intern to day 2000 is unfeasible. Instead, plan out what you can do now to make your idea happen. The same holds for smaller scoped ideas — if your goal is to double how much you can bench and squat, have a plan to incrementally increase your weight each week. Focus on what you can do now to get you closer to your idea. If you aren’t doing something now, how is it going to happen later?

3. Talk about your idea to others.
Talk about your idea! Talking about your idea gives you different perspectives which can often help you perfect your idea. Talking about your idea allows others to find loopholes that you overlooked, and it helps strengthen your idea.

“But they might think my idea is dumb or lame” — if this is your thought but you honestly believe that you have an idea worth chasing, then all the more reason to talk about the idea. Prove that your idea is awesome. Show the passion that you have for it. Be strong in defending your idea, as talking with others will give you the confidence you may later need.

Talking about your idea can lead to connections and resources that you didn’t know existed. Even our closest friends have extensive networks that we do not know about. A connection through a friend is the best kind of introduction — not just in business but also in relationships and other interpersonal situations. Talking about your idea can result in new connections and tools to accomplish it.

4. Use Google violently.
This common knowledge is worth reemphasizing. Google is square one. The chances that somebody has done something similar to your idea are high. Do a thorough google search, find examples. Look at what they did. Replicate it. Do it better. Google is a great equalizer, and there aren’t many ideas that Google can’t point you in the right direction for. Instead of wondering how to get your idea done with “little prior experience”, just Google it and you’ll be using the same knowledge base that people with more experience probably use anyway! Here’s a great infographic on how you can become a Google Search Jedi Master.

5. Believe in yourself.
You can do it! There are people all over the world in worse situations who have done bigger things. You are the only thing holding yourself back. If you doubt yourself, then the rest of the world will doubt you too. On the contrary if you believe you can make your idea happen, maybe the world will start to see it from your eyes. Put more effort in than anyone else — prove the world wrong.

The first step to greatness is believing that you are already great. Good luck with your 2016!
