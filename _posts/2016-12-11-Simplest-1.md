An onboarding guide for those that use Slack and want to leverage Fireflies.ai for intelligent workflows.
Let’s keep this short. The reason you decided to give Fireflies a try is because you want to make tasks inside your conversations and turn messages into tasks without having to leave Slack.
Fireflies is the team assistant that helps you create, route, and manage tasks within seconds. Here’s how:

Instantly add tasks by saying FF: before each message.
Assign tasks to someone by tagging the person in the message.
FF: Fix Website @Sam

One emoji to rule them all.
The + (plus) emoji has a lot of magical powers when you use Fireflies.

React to any message with a + and that message will become a task.
When you create tasks with FF: or mark messages with a + emoji, Fireflies is getting smarter. That’s when the AI kicks in!
