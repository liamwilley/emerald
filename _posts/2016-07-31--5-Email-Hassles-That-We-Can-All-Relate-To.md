---

In the era of Slack and Group Messaging, many will say email is dead. Both you and I know this is far from the truth.

Email is still the life blood of most business organizations. Studies show that half your time at work is spent on some form of email communication. Even in your personal life, you’re getting a high volume of incoming email, most of which is spam and newsletters, but from time to time, there are very important emails that you still need to follow up on.

In our quest to build an ideal AI assistant to manage our email hassles, we spoke to numerous people, dug into research, and distilled the 5 most common hassles with email that we all have.

1. Forgetting to simply respond at a later time
You’re on the go while scrolling through email. There is a message you need to respond to, but now is not the right time. For whatever reason, you make a mental note that you need to reply back next Friday. You might be savvy and flag the emails to be read at a later time. Let’s be honest with ourselves, with the amount of mail we get, it’s hard to go back and look. It’s like those interesting pages you used to bookmark on the web to read at a later time. Do you remember what I’m taking about? Yea, neither do I because we never actually go back.

2. Having important emails get buried when you need them the most
Even when you make a mental note to respond to an email, hundreds of other emails pile on top of that one important message. I try using the search bar, grasping at some key words I vaguely remember from the message. The amount of time we spend doing this on a weekly basis really adds up.

3. Constantly having to check in on co-workers for status updates
While we are constantly collaborating in the workspace, we are also spending a lot of time checking in with others and waiting for responses. For example, I’ll ask my engineering team if I can get an update on a recent issue. My peers are just as busy as I am, if not more. Many times, the first follow up doesn’t get a response. Usually I’ll bump the thread after a couple days by literally replying “Ping…” It can be annoying to remember to manually do this. Neither party wants the issue to fall through the cracks, but it can be very hard to stay on top of these communication updates with so much going on.

4. Knowing which emails you should actually be answering
I know Gmail has taken a step in the right direction by organizing my emails into Primary, Social, and Promotions folders. However, that does not stop the barrage of unimportant emails coming into my primary inbox. Ironically, some important emails end up going to the promotions folder, which I never look at. We all wish there was a way to automatically know which emails need a response versus those that I can ignore for a later time. I tend to make my morning To Do list from my emails. Imagine if your inbox was prioritized by tasks that needed to be completed!

5. Losing touch with important contacts
While email isn’t the best place to be social, I do have important contacts I want to touch basis with every couple months. For this, I really don’t need a complex CRM solution. I just need the ability to set a gentle reminder for contacts that I feel are important. If my email could tell me who I’m losing touch with, that would be a bonus. Our inboxes are a treasure trove of contacts. We are more likely to reach out and message these people than the LinkedIn contacts we added after a brief interaction at a conference.

There are many tools, apps, plugins, dashboards, and extensions out there that make your email a little more bearable. However, our goal is give people a fully equipped email assistant that doesn’t require you to download any extra tool. Fireflies.AI lives right in your inbox and handles the hassles mentioned above like a personal secretary.

We’re working on an AI assistant that maximizes email productivity by figuring out who you need to talk to and what tasks to follow up on.

We’re looking for feedback and doing user interviews. Private Beta starts soon. If you’d like to chat more about this, reach me at:
