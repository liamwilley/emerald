title: HOW WE ACCIDENTALLY BUILT AN AI ASSISTANT THAT WE FELL IN LOVE WITH
---

My co-founder, Sam Udotong, and I had just moved to SF. We were all set to embark on our startup journey. I mean why else would we pack our bags and buy a one-way ticket to the bay area. At the time, we were attempting to build an email management tool for enterprise businesses. We were reaching out to a lot of people during those initial days because we needed to start somewhere within the tech community.

Sam and I were constantly:
Messaging fellow entrepreneurs on Facebook.
Reaching out to early customers on Slack.
Emailing dozens of companies to try out our product.
Though we weren’t getting much traction, we were able to have those initial conversations. We were doing a few things on loop over and over again:
Setting up regular coffee chats and meeting up with other founders
Promising to deliver on requests to our users
Letting business leads know that we would follow up
There was so much back and forth communication happening each day. It was hard to stay on top of everything I needed to do because my tasks would be hidden somewhere in a message or email I had written to someone. On top of that, we were simultaneously doing all this while building our product.
I would spend 1 hour every morning making a to-do list of who I needed to meet, what I needed to send someone, and which person I had to follow up with.

One night, Sam and I laughed at how great it would be to have our own assistant. We clearly knew we were in no position to hire one. When you’re bootstrapping, you just don’t have that luxury.

What we really needed was a person who could manage all our conversations and tell us exactly what to get done each day. That sounded very expensive.It was probably more realistic for us to build our own assistant than hire a real one. The idea was intriguing. We started thinking about what was the simplest thing this hypothetical AI assistant could do that would make our lives 10x easier.

Designing our ideal AI Assistant

Then we got excited by the possibilities. What started out as a personal wish gained some momentum. We started thinking about it more and more each day. Before we knew it, we were specing out designs during the 15 minutes of free time we had for lunch and dinner. We realized how 60% of our current email management stack was already doing the preliminary things needed to build this barebones assistant.

Before we got too distracted on our current work, we decided to set aside 1 week to try this out. It was a huge risk considering how much that would cost our current plans. But what the heck! It was worth shot. At the very least, we would have a neat little hack that would save us time on our daily communication. Out of that mindset came the new fireflies.ai. The magic moment was when I found the tool helpful even when it was just 20% complete. That felt special to us for the first time.

So we did end up building an an AI assistant to manage our daily tasks!
The concept is simple to start with. As I chat across communication platforms like Facebook, Slack, and Email, fireflies.ai will keep tabs on the important things I say and identify what I need to get done from those conversations. It will apply Natural Language Processing and basic Machine Learning to create and classify tasks. I can then easily route these to my calendar or a to-do list.

The reason we even got this far was because we were dealing with the problem everyday. Communication overload is real, and it can get very irritating. Now, each time fireflies reminds me about an important task, I realize how grateful we are to have it in our life. That’s definitely a special feeling.

I truly believe there are many others like us who could use a tool like fireflies.ai. Share your thoughts. We’d love to have you try it out! The assistant is not perfect, but we are making it smarter every single day. With more training and your feedback, we’ll definitely get there.
