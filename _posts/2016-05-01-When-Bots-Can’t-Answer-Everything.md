title: When Bots Can’t Answer Everything
---

We’ve entered an era of chat assistants. Conversation as a platform is here thanks to some major moves by Facebook, Microsoft, Slack, Telegram, Kik, etc. Yeah yeah, we get it already. This is old news, tell me something new, you say.

Well, the new news is all about how these bots are being received. The initial response by consumers has been lukewarm at best. They definitely caught peoples’ attention, but after some time, many users were not too excited by the unintelligent conversations they were having. Don’t take it from me, here’s what people are actually saying about bots:

Why does Facebook want me to chat with dumb robots?
Chatting with bots is downright annoying, confusing…

Now hold on! Let’s give bot developers some time.

It’s early and the community of developers are still wrapping their heads around how to make bots more useful and fun to chat with. As someone invested in chat bots and the AI scene for the last 8 months, this is a big deal. Our chat assistant, Fireflies AI, has made astronomical strides in the past few months. Many of our users remember those initial days where they had to use /help commands to interact with Fireflies. It was literally like a command prompt. Like us, many fellow bot enthusiasts and developers are at that stage right now. It’s early days for bots.

Eventually, our team at Fireflies doubled down on creating a good end user experience. We learned, and we developed this concept of Interaction Experience (IX) where we train the AI to have focused conversations without friction. Fireflies now can understand natural speech. It’s pretty clever, and it has a personality of it’s own. At the same time, this is just the start. Fireflies is a continual work in progress. There is a lot that will improve overtime, and that is expected.

Let’s talk about why bots are unintelligent right now. When we give users unlimited power in how they can interact with a piece of software, the varying responses that get thrown at the poor bot become too combinatorial.

It really is a problem that keeps multiplexing and not that easily solved. Most bot developers don’t have the luxury of using ML models, Natural Language Processing, or Deep Learning to tackle these hard challenges.
Even after spending months, we are just scratching the surface with ML and NLP. However, innovation will find a way to thrive, and I am confident that bot developers will find workarounds to tackling this difficult problem. Something I wanted to share with the bot community is one solution we developed that has been very effective. The common feedback I usually hear from fellow bot developers is:

When my bot doesn’t know how to answer something or malfunctions, I want to be able to step in and help it out.

We all want to guide our bots to do their best.

This is something even Facebook M is striving to do. Facebook M uses a combination of AI and human help to answer user questions. Imagine how effective this would be for developers and how much time it would save for a user who is interacting with the bot.

As part of our internal tools, we’ve invested in building a Helper Bot (no pun intended) that informs us when Fireflies is not able to answer a user. Then an admin can step in and make sure that the conversation continues until Fireflies can take control again.

We look back at the number of conversations we’ve saved, and the countless improvement areas we discovered through this tool. I really believe that this Helper Bot tool can be taken to another level in the future. We want to be able to use the Helper Bot to train Fireflies. Each time Fireflies gets stuck, it will learn how to respond by understanding how the human operator responded. Eventually, we can automate this learning process and Fireflies becomes this dynamic AI that grows smarter in a structured way, ultimately reducing the number of times it gets stuck.

If you’re interested in learning more about the Helper Bot or have more thoughts you’d like to share with us, drop us a quick message here.
