How can we actually stay connected online?
The social age has brought us so much. Our real-world friendships have transferred online. We have a reason to share thousands of photos with colorful filters and selfies that disappear in seconds. We can even stamp our approval on anything with a big like button. Being more connected than ever is a good thing. I’d say it’s the best thing to happen since the Internet in the 1990’s. Facebook and other social media giants have done a wonderful job connecting the entire world and keeping us engaged.

Some where along the way though, we ended up experiencing social media overload. Digital tech helps us handle the breadth of connections extremely well. However, maintaining the depth of these connections is much more difficult.

Many of us actually want to stay in touch with that friend from high school or the cousin who is across the country. In the end, all we do is like the person’s photo in passing and continue scrolling. Something is missing. That magic moment when you reconnect with a friend after 6 years or that nostalgic feeling when you have a conversation reminiscing about the past doesn’t occur too often online. There are too many people we have to keep tabs on, several things we have to get done, and countless distractions every time we pull out our phones.

The more connected we try to be, the less we actually stay connected.

Think of how many friends you talk to online every month. Of the thousand friends you have, you probably message 5 people regularly. It’s not that the rest don’t matter. Well… if you had all the time in the world, you would atleast keep in touch with 10 more people right?
I’m talking about having actual conversations. The newsfeed is not a replacement for that. Sending photos that dissapear after 4 seconds is convenient, but it’s not the engagement I’m referring to.

Social interactions are the most powerful things in the world. They build billion dollar businesses. FB, Linkedin, Airbnb, and Uber made their empires connecting people. Interactions help you network to get that job you’ve always wanted. Effective collaboration enables scientists to find cures to deadly diseases. Furthermore, these interactions make you who you are. They help you find friends, feel happy, and have that sense of belonging. Without this form of engagement, we don’t exist and society doesn’t move forward. In a world where the time spent online equals time spent in the real-world, these relationships need to be sustained the right way online.

It’s easy to tell someone to keep in touch. All it takes is one quick message right? Not really. Keeping in touch and initiating conversation takes time and more energy than what meets the eye. It’s a conscious effort where I need to think about what to say, be aware of what’s happening in that other person’s life, and actually type the text in the right way. Social media makes it easy for us to avoid all this by being passive.

I’ll just like that post, comment on that photo, and assume that we are connected. We can’t have it both ways.

Like many of you, I had fallen into the same trap of feeling connected by being passive on social media. I have worked hard to break the cycle by forcing myself to set aside time and reach out to the people that matter in my life. I know that not everyone has this time to spare, and I myself was getting busier with the Fireflies AI project. While working one night, the Fireflies team realized how we could automate the painful points of starting up social interactions. Rather than build a typical personal assistant, we decided to leverage our technology and build the very first social assistant anyone would ever use. As a result,

Fireflies AI will now automatically keep tabs on friends I want to stay in touch with. It will send me relevant information, let me know when I should start a conversation, and figure out what I could potentially discuss with my friends.

We had always felt AI was this abstract tech that was many years away from proper consumerization. When I look back at the things that we want to do with a context-aware assistant, I now see how Fireflies AI can solve many complex challenges. We have an opportunity to leverage AI to put people at the center of technological innovation. In my mind, AI is not meant to replace people. It should be used to strengthen relationships and keep us better connected. To me, staying connected, maintaining friendships, and having meaningful conversations is extremely valuable. Having Fireflies AI be able to help me and thousands of others do the same thing is priceless.
