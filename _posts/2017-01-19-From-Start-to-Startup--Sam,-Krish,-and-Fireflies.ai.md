title: FROM START TO STARTUP- SAM, KRISH, AND FIREFLIES.AI
---

A hundred un-read e-mails. Six notifications from the Slack #deliverables channel. One text from your manager on your work phone asking for an 8:30 A.M. team meeting.

It’s only 8:00 A.M. on Monday morning as you arrive at work. As you sit down at your desk, your colleague messages you about that status report you promised to write up.

You completely forgot that she even made that request early last week. You reply back on Slack that you’ll get it to her by the end of the day.

Except you won’t. You’re not even fifteen minutes into your day and all of these fires need to be put out. It’ll take you at least another hour of your day to figure out how to schedule your day to take care of the highest priority items first.

What are the ‘highest priority items’ anyway? That’ll take some additional time to figure out as well.

As you begin to start organizing your day and prepare a plan of attack to complete your work, you can’t help but think if there were some tool that could do this all for you. You could be using the nth project management tool, but the reality is that your actual work is buried within communication channels. If you didn’t have to bounce back and forth between your messages and project management system, you would be able to actually complete the main job you were hired to do.

It’s 8:25. Meeting’s about to start. Better head over there before your boss gets on your case too.

While you head over to the meeting, two entrepreneurs have the solution you need, packaged in the form of a personal assistant on Slack.

Fireflies.ai is a chatbot powered by artificial intelligence that helps you track work and automate tasks from your team communication channels, saving you precious time from lost information. Sam Udotong and Krish Ramineni are the co-founders of the product which was made to organize your work day so you can be more productive in the office.

After extensive testing and feedback from teams and small businesses, the two are confident in releasing their product to the marketplace to make the workplace more productive.

It’s been a hectic week. You can tell Sam and Krish are running on little sleep, but are too excited to stop for a break. Putting in the final code changes, making sure the servers are ready to scale, and keeping an eye on a massive monitor which has a dashboard, they are completely consumed by their work. The typing stops abruptly as both sit back down and nod in agreement. It was a sign of approval. Things were ready to go.  

Minutes later, they are trending on the front page of ProductHunt, a platform popularly known for big startup launches. Their bracing themselves for the immense traffic coming their way, but know that the war has just begun.

The real test will be seeing how much time each person at a company will save when they use Fireflies. That’s always been the founder’s northstar since the day this all began.

Sam and Krish looked at one another. In this moment of reflection, they found themselves in awe as they are at the crossroads of an important journey for both of them. One question came to mind as they pondered their deep thoughts.

How did this all begin?

The duo met while Sam Udotong was a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014. His choice of major was Aerospace Engineering, more commonly known as 'Course 16’ at the math and science institution. The ‘Course 16’ junior always had a deep love for flight, but his passions truly lay in the sub-discipline of avionics and controls. His avionics internships at esteemed companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing gave him first-hand experience of designing control systems. These avionic components helped air and spacecraft process large volumes of data in order for the human in the loop to make the proper decisions to ensure smooth, steady level flight.

Udotong’s experience in control software for various air and spacecraft must have led him to think similar usage for a human’s daily decision making. If there could be software to help the decision-making of a pilot, then surely one could create a similar functioning program for daily human use. This software could be powered by artificial intelligence and sit on a smartphone to help humans focus on creative solutions to pressing problems.

Luckily, Sam was not alone in thinking this. His partner, Krish Ramineni, also felt the need for software to automate the biggest hassles in a person’s life to help boost overall productivity. He was a student at the University of Pennsylvania. Originally, Krish planned to travel the well-worn path leading to either finance at an bulge bracket investment bank or a prestigious consulting firm. However, his freshman summer at a startup changed his whole career trajectory. The technical perspective that flowed through the small company’s work environment fascinated Krish. The product-driven culture left him hungering for more similar experiences. During his sophomore year, he felt disillusioned by the aims and goals of what he truly wanted to achieve in finance and consulting.

In essence, he wanted to make a lasting impact by putting technology directly in the hands of everyday people and empowering them to achieve more. He had realized early on that something as ubiquitous as software can transform the lives of millions of people very quickly and with very little capital. All you need is an internet connection and a computing device. He felt these tools were the gateway to changing the status quo.

Krish switched his focus to Entrepreneurship and never looked back. He enjoyed building applications and designing systems out of a pure joy for the creative process. By the time he met Sam at a Bitcoin hackathon at MIT, he was just finishing up an internship at Workday as a Product Manager. He and Sam had much in common from the get-go, and were itching to build a product that could increase the average person’s productivity. The two noticed how chatbots, artificial intelligence applications that were being increasingly used by companies to engage potential customers over messaging services such as Slack or Facebook Messenger. AI was becoming a trending theme within the tech industry, and the two knew that this was a loaded term thrown around by far too many people. However, they saw the value of particular aspects of machine learning and neuro-linguistic programming in boosting productivity. Their own experience as being undergraduates at prestigious universities known for overworking their students gave them first hand experience of people who would benefit from workflow automation.   

Yet life pulled them in two different directions – Sam had to finish his undergraduate education at MIT, and Krish went off to work to become a Product Manager at Microsoft. Still, the two did not let time and distance get in the way of them working together on fun side-projects. Their time exploring their hobbies together built the foundation of their partnership to create Fireflies. For two years, they spent time building Fireflies by skyping every other weekend. Their dedication could only be matched by their ability to iterate. They went through “six or seven” different products until they settled at a cross within the productivity and chatbot space. Sam and Krish were able to build and release a small social bot that quickly went viral at a few local schools, showing them the power and promise of chatbots that were based on the foundations of machine learning.

Together in person, they could create a product that could augment a human’s ability to get things done in the workplace. Krish realized his opportunity to work on a product like Fireflies did not come around too often. With some time before the start of Business School at Cambridge University, he stopped by Boston to work with Sam. Within a few days, he realized graduate school could wait and focused his attention into making Fireflies.ai reality with Sam.

With Sam’s technical chops and Krish’s design and product skills, Fireflies would cease to exist as only an idea, but a tangible application just a tap away on your phone screen. Sam and Krish together got what would have taken them “two-to-three years” done in six months by being physically in the same room working 15 hours a day. The two hustled across Boston, garnering feedback from the technology ecosystem at large. Boston had a phenomenal AI scene thanks to MIT and Harvard. Establishing growth and traction were now the fundamental business challenges they switched their attention towards. They knew their market was in the workplace and Krish’s experience working at large enterprise software companies helped them really drill down on the relevant use cases for working professionals.

The two found that they were good at tackling solutions to hard engineering problems, but they had difficulty translating user feedback into consistent features. Each business and company required a tailored solution to their own unique problems. Sam and Krish knew that if they couldn’t deliver their product to small and medium size businesses, then there could be no path forward.

The question they needed to now answer was:

Why Fireflies?

The duo found themselves answering this question not in Boston, but in San Francisco. San Francisco is the mecca of everything concerning technology and startups. The two felt that is were the greatest opportunities lay, and where they best had a chance at answering that pivotal question. The valley accepts new technology and most companies from small startups to large corporations follow a similar set of principles in the workplace. There were just more companies that these guys could deliver their software to. Yet, they had to sacrifice plenty of other prospects as well. Krish scuttled plans to complete business schoolt at Cambridge in the UK. Sam turned down graduate programs within Stanford’s Computer Science and MIT’s AeroAstro departments, and deferred his matriculation into Harvard Business School for his MBA via their 2+2 program.

Others would kill for the opportunity to enroll in anyone of these programs, let alone be admitted. Yet these two turned those chances down all to answer one question.

Why Fireflies?

As they worked out from coffee shop to coffee shop, they ran into several key players in the tech scene, ranging from early employees at Dropbox to heralded partners at prominent venture capital firms. All of these individuals gave crucial feedback to Sam and Krish as they demonstrated Fireflies to them. The high-quality advice they received was key to molding their product into what it is today.

Sam felt that coming from Boston gave them a hidden advantage. In an ecosystem such as San Francisco, where everyone is “drinking the kool-aid” and promising that their startup is going to be the next big thing, living in a more traditional city early on allowed them to see through the hype that SF tech scene has. The two knew that they had to continue to stay levelheaded and humble as they pushed towards developing an application that people would willingly recommend to their colleagues. Having this clear-eyed perspective allowed them to filter out flattery from critical advice from users, and kept them focused on building an product that did a few things well rather than everything poorly.

The two grew adjusted to their new life in San Francisco as they continued building Fireflies relentlessly. Their passion for their product was evident in their dedication to building it. As they neared closer to their goal of having an app ready to showcase to the world, they kept the one question in mind.

Why Fireflies?

Sam and Krish both noticed the trend towards automation in certain knowledge-based jobs. Automation had become something to fear and to worship at the same time. The power to increase the productivity of businesses by many fold was enticing for the few who own, while the despair of human labor becoming obsolete was dread-inducing for the many who work.

Sam and Krish didn’t see things that way though. They viewed automation as removing the need to complete rote tasks and allowing people to “focus on the creative work that they were hired for.” They believed that just like the use of the computer and smartphone created technology-enabled businesses in the last two decades, there will be another shift making  every job become “AI-enabled.” There will be an “intelligence layer” of the work stream that every employee will be able to tap into to make themselves more effective at getting things done.

Their goal was never to build an app to replace you, but to build a tool that will supercharge you to accomplish more in the limited time we have when working. Fireflies is meant to augment your fiery passion and actually enjoy your job. Fireflies is meant to change the way we do business because bolstering the available intelligence a person has with AI will help you be the most effective in the workplace.

Fireflies allows you to focus on the things that matter.

Prometheus defied the will of the Olympian gods to give man fire.

Sam and Krish are defying the mundane work you are forced to do by giving people Fireflies.

Here’s to a more productive and bright future.

Here’s to Fireflies.
