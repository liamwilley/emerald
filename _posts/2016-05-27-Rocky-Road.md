It’s one great Ice Cream flavor. One of the most fun songs to try singing by The Dubliners. And it’s something everyone who works on a startup experiences.

Working on a startup is intense and demanding. Adrenaline will pump through your body every day and night. You will experience the highest of highs and the lowest of lows of your life. When you stumble and fall you will get right up and keep going. There will be lots of people who get in your way that don’t believe in your vision and mountains that might seem just too high to climb. Unless you keep going, you’re not going to learn what it takes. The Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerburgs of today didn’t become successful overnight.

There isn’t an easy way to make your startup successful. Because “success” is relative. Raised $2 million? Over 100,000 users? IPO’d? Sold your company for $20 million? To someone peeking from the outside, these all sound somewhat successful. When we look at the “successful” startups, the Google or Uber of the world, they don’t just crush these milestones, it takes a ton of hardware and luck to get there. It’s not until they’re one of largest companies in the world and are valued at billions that everyone starts paying attention to how much they changed the world around us. They make it look easy, just like the Jordan’s and Messi’s of the sports world.

However, it’s the moments before raising large rounds and getting international fame that most tech entrepreneurs are excited by (including me). Trying to build something from scratch, going from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows, and trying to build a successful business around your idea is addicting. It is so addicting even though only 8% of startups survive 3 years, millions still strive to build their own success stories.

These highs and lows are fun. Seriously. I love finals week for one reason: because you are pushed to your absolute max in a really short period of time. And that’s what startups are. Its a race between you and time. No one cares what you’re doing except yourself. You have to push yourself to do things you haven’t done before. You have to be at your absolute best. Because if you’re not — you’re going to fail.

Working on Fireflies AI has really pushed me. I’m writing more code than ever and facing new challenges. I’m taking risks that would usually make me run away and hide under the covers. I’m experiencing what it takes to take an idea and build a company around it. It not only requires great technical skill, but also a lot of care and attention to detail. You have to make sure all the engines are firing at full throttle, because you need great execution with the tech you build. It’s a lot more than just code. You need to design, market, and sell like that’s what you do for a living.

You can’t go out and hire for every small need. You have to get scrappy. Not everything is going to be perfect, but you need to get it as close to perfection if you want to succeed. When you’re building a startup every decision matters. Need a new website design? New marketing content? Business model? New tech in a field you’ve never touched? Starting researching and doing what needs to be done. Because no one is going to hold your hand if you want to be successful.
