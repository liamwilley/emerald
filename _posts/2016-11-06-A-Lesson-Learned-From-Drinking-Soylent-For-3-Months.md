Spoiler: it isn’t related to stomach problems.

The low waste, environmentally friendly bottle of Soylent
It’s been almost three months since I started drinking Soylent. On average, I drink one bottle every single day. And I’m still not exactly sure what it is.

According to their website, Soylent is a nutritious “meal in a bottle” that is a convenient, cheap and environmentally conscious alternative to the traditional meal. At around $3 per bottle, it is a trendy drink choice for young entrepreneurs who want to save money and while maintaining a decent diet.
Recent news about Soylent include some recalls on their powder product and food bar product due to rising complaints about stomach problems. Thankfully, the bottled products do not seem to be causing any sort of problems.

I personally enjoy a refrigerated bottle of Soylent for breakfast/brunch. For those that are curious, the taste reminds me of vanilla ice cream stripped away of all signs of sweetness and mixed with some flour and protein powder. The texture is just a tad too thick, but it is well processed, making it easily bearable.
From what I’ve described so far, it seems that my food situation is a living nightmare. However, just the opposite is true — I’m absolutely loving it. I am not drinking Soylent for its trendiness, its nutritional value or even its price — though price was the original inspiration.

It’s much more than that. Let me explain:

Soylent streamlines my life
The real reason that I am still continuing with Soylent is that it lets me focus on things that matter to me. With Soylent, I can prepare, consume and clean up my meal in well under 3 minutes.
This saves me at least an hour of time everyday, and is even more valuable in the amount of mental space that is saved. Instead of worrying about the next meal or figuring out where to go among hundreds of restaurants in San Francisco, I can turn my focus to other important things in my life.

Soylent has helped teach me to eliminate as many distractions as possible. I’m able to focus on doing things that will advance my goals. Sometimes I find myself wishing that I had a tube connected to my body that completely satiates any hunger and nutritional need. Although I enjoy the social experience of sharing meals, the consumption itself is never that exciting.

My high school wrestling coach gave me a piece of advice that continues to inspire me each and every day:
Worry about what’s in your control.

For me, this advice has formed into a stubborn desire to use my time as well as possible, and to do everything with 100% energy. To a large degree, it explains how I socialize, how I work and how I dream.
This advice even helps to explain my startup Fireflies.ai. Our company uses artificial intelligence to help sort through the cluttered streams of information that have become routine. We do this with a chrome extension that keeps track of every promise you make and automatically puts it on your to-do list.

My experience with Soylent has become an insightful part of the narrative that I want to form for myself. I will continue to look for ways to eliminate distractions and live a purposeful life. Please comment if you have any insights in how you eliminate distractions!
